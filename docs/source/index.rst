How to Fix Canon Printer Not Connecting to Internet on Windows and Mac
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these proven troubleshooting steps to restore your Canon printer’s internet connection:

✅ **Check Wi-Fi Signal Strength**

Ensure your printer is within range of your Wi-Fi router. If the signal is weak, try moving the printer closer to the router or repositioning the router to reduce interference.

✅ **Restart Printer, Router, and Computer**

Power off your printer, router, and computer. Wait about 60 seconds, then turn them back on. This can clear temporary connection issues on all devices.

✅ **Reconnect the Printer to Wi-Fi Network**

Use your printer’s control panel or Canon’s setup utility:

- **On the Printer Display:**
Go to *Settings > Network Settings > Wireless LAN Setup*, select your Wi-Fi network, and enter the correct password.

- **Via Computer (Windows or Mac):**
Use *Canon IJ Network Tool* or *Canon Printer Setup Utility* to reconnect the printer.

✅ **Update Printer Drivers and Firmware**

Visit the Canon Support website and download the latest drivers and firmware for your printer model. Install them on your Windows or Mac system to ensure compatibility.

✅ **Check Printer Status on Windows and Mac**

- **On Windows:**
Go to *Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners*, select your printer, and ensure it’s not paused or offline.

- **On Mac:**
Go to *System Preferences > Printers & Scanners*, select your printer, and check its status. Remove and re-add the printer if necessary.

✅ **Run the Network Troubleshooter**

- **Windows:**
*Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional Troubleshooters > Internet Connections.*

- **Mac:**
Use *Wireless Diagnostics* from the Wi-Fi menu or restart your Wi-Fi service in *Network Preferences.*

✅ **Disable Firewall or Security Software Temporarily**

Sometimes, firewall or antivirus programs can block network communication. Disable them briefly to test if the printer connects successfully.

✅ **Reset Network Settings on the Printer**

As a last resort, reset the printer’s network settings:

On the printer’s control panel, go to *Settings > Device Settings > Reset Settings > Reset LAN Settings*.
Then reconnect the printer to your Wi-Fi network.
